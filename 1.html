    <h2>cheese pizza</h2>

    <p>The most popular cheeses used in the preparation of pizza are mozzarella (accounting for about 30%), provolone, cheddar and Parmesan. Emmental,
         Romano and ricotta are often used as toppings, and processed pizza cheeses manufactured specifically for pizza are mass-produced.</p>

    <p>For the paneer tikka pizza we marinate the paneer cubes with onion, spices and yogurt. We then let it sit for a minimum
       of 1 hour and then spread it on a pizza base and bake the pizza. You should also use cubed red/green bell peppers [capsicum] here.</p>

       <h2>corn pizza</h2>
    <img src="images/golden corn pizza.jpg"  height="20%" width="20%" alt="" title="corn pizza">
    <p>The most abundant proteins in corn are known as zeins, accounting for 44-79% of the total protein content ( 6 , 7 ). Overall,
         the protein quality of zeins is poor because they lack some essential amino acids ( 8 ).</p>
